RVM was widely accepted as the norm, greatly due to its wide toolkit. rbenv has become a strong contender with its lightweight approach. So, how do these tools get the job done? This is where things get a little scary with RVM. RVM overrides the cd shell command in order to load the current Ruby environment variables. Not only can the override cause unexpected behavior, but it also means that rubies and gemsets are loaded when switching directories. rbenv does things on the fly by using shims to execute commands. A directory of shims (~/.rbenv/shims) is inserted to the front of PATH. The directory holds a shim for every Ruby command. The operating system searches for a shim that matches the name of the command, which in turn passes it to rbenv, determining the Ruby version to execute. rbenv configuration for an app is dirt simple.

</code></pre></div></div>
<ol>
  <li>Finally, install <a href="https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-vars">rbenv-vars</a>. This is a plugin for rbenv that lets you set global and project-specific environment variables before spawning Ruby processes: ` brew install rbenv-vars `</li>
  <li>Run ` which -a ruby ` to check that now there is another ruby installed alongside the built-in one.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="checking-installed-versions">Checking installed versions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Check installed Ruby versions with rbenv with:  ` rbenv versions `</li>
  <li>The one which is been using in this folder is highlighted with an ` * `</li>
  <li>You can choose which version have to be used:</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>rbenv <span class="nb">local </span>3.1.2 <span class="c"># Set up version for this folder by generaling .rben-version file (only if this Ruby version has been previously installed)</span>
rbenv global 3.1.2 <span class="c"># Set up default version if there is no specific one</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<ul>
  <li>Also, you can <strong>manually set the correct Ruby version</strong> by add it in ` .ruby-version ` file (it affects all folder tree). Remenber that in a Rails project this version have to be the same specified in ` Gemfile`.</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>rbenv versions

<h4 id="uninstalling-rbenv-and-installed-ruby-versions">Uninstalling rbenv and installed ruby versions</h4>

<ol>
  <li>The goal is to uninstall all ruby versions installed by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rbenv</code> before uninstalling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rbenv</code> itself.</li>
  <li>Check installed ruby versions:  ` rbenv versions `</li>
  <li>Uninstall all versions:</li>
</ol>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>rbenv uninstall x.y.z <span class="c"># uninstall all versions from the last step`</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<ol>
  <li>Finally, uninstall ` rbenv `:
    <div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>brew uninstall rbenv
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="rails">Rails</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Install Rails by running: ` sudo gem install rails `</li>
  <li>Restart terminal.</li>
  <li>Check installed version:</li>
</ol>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>rails <span class="nt">-v</span>     
<span class="c"># =&gt; Rails 7.0.4</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>To install one specific version of Rails: ` gem install rails -v 6.0.3 `</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create a Rails project using a specific version of rails: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rbenv exec rails _6_0_3_ new my_project</code>. You can change project’s Rails version like another gem dependencies in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gemfile</code>. Don’t forget run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle install</code> after that. <a href="https://blog.adev42.com/how-to-switch-to-another-rails-version">How to switch to another Rails version.</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'rails', '6.0.3'
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="unistall-gems">Unistall gems</h4>
<p>Since Rubygems 2.1, without gem names, it just removes all of them!  So simply run:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>gem uninstall -aIx
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Details of options:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-a</code> Uninstall all matching versions</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-I</code> Ignore dependency requirements while uninstalling</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-x</code> Uninstall applicable executables without confirmation</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="unistall-rails">Unistall Rails</h4>
<p>Two steps to completelly remove Rails from the computer:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem uninstall rails</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem uninstall railties</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="rbenv-vs-rvm---why-choose-rbenv">rbenv vs RVM - Why choose rbenv?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>RVM was widely accepted as the norm, greatly due to its wide toolkit.</li>
  <li>rbenv has become a strong contender with its lightweight approach.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, how do these tools get the job done? This is where things get a little scary with RVM.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>RVM overrides the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> shell command in order to load the current Ruby environment variables. Not only can the override cause unexpected behavior, but it also means that rubies and gemsets are loaded when switching directories.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>rbenv does things on the fly by using shims to execute commands.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A directory of shims (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.rbenv/shims</code>) is inserted to the front of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PATH</code>.</li>
      <li>The directory holds a shim for every Ruby command.</li>
      <li>The operating system searches for a shim that matches the name of the command, which in turn passes it to rbenv, determining the Ruby version to execute.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>rbenv configuration for an app is dirt simple. Just create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.ruby-version</code> file with Ruby version:</p>

<div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># .ruby-version file</span>
<span class="s">2.3.0</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RBENV_VERSION</code> variable also makes it easy to quickly specify a Ruby version via the command line. It’s first in line when rbenv checks for the current Ruby version.</p>
