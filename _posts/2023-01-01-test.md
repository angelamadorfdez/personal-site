- MacOs includes Ruby with OS. 
- You can check the version with: ` ruby -v `
- If ` which -a ruby ` shows ` # => /usr/bin/ruby `, this is the included one.
- You **shouldn't use or delete the in-built Ruby** version in MacOs:
	- [Do Not Use the MacOS System Ruby](https://mac.install.guide/faq/do-not-use-mac-system-ruby/index.html)
	- [Don't Use the Mac System Ruby – Use This Instead](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/do-not-use-mac-system-ruby-do-this-instead/).
	- [Uninstall Ruby on Mac](https://mac.install.guide/ruby/9.html)
- For developing projects you should use a **Ruby Version Manager** such as asdf, chruby, **rbenv**, or rvm.

## rbenv (Ruby Environment)

- **rbenv** is a version manager tool for the Ruby programming language on Unix-like systems. 
- It is useful for **switching between multiple Ruby versions on the same machine** and for ensuring that each project you are working on always runs on the correct Ruby version.
- Official repository: https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv
- Put rbenv to work with [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) for painless Ruby upgrades and bulletproof deployments.

#### Installing rbenv
Official guide: https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#using-package-managers

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
#
# INSTALLING PROCESS
# 
brew -v
# => Homebrew 3.6.17
# => Homebrew/homebrew-core (git revision 005f6b96107; last commit 2023-01-02)
```

2. Install rbenv:  ` brew install rbenv ruby-build `
3. Set up rbenv in your shell (and follow the printed instruction):

```shell
rbenv init
# => Load rbenv automatically by appending the following to ~/.zshrc: 
# => eval "$(rbenv init - zsh)"
```

So, you have to add ` eval "$(rbenv init - zsh)" ` to the ` ~/.zshrc ` config file for ZSH shell:

```shell
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init - zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

4. Close your Terminal window and open a new one so your changes take effect.
5. Verify that rbenv is properly set up using this [rbenv-doctor](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer#rbenv-doctor) script:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/main/bin/rbenv-doctor | bash

# => Checking for `rbenv' in PATH: /usr/local/bin/rbenv
# => Checking for rbenv shims in PATH: OK
# => Checking `rbenv install' support: /usr/local/bin/rbenv-install (ruby-build 20221225)
# => Counting installed Ruby versions: **none**
# => There aren't any Ruby versions installed under `/Users/angelamador/.rbenv/versions'.
# => You can install Ruby versions like so: **rbenv install 3.2.0**
# => Auditing installed plugins: OK
```

6. Installing rbenv includes [ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build) plugin, so now you're ready to [install some Ruby versions](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installing-ruby-versions) using `rbenv install` (ie: ` rbenv install 2.7.4 `)

```shell
curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/HEAD/bin/rbenv-doctor | bash

# => Checking for `rbenv' in PATH: /usr/local/bin/rbenv
# => Checking for rbenv shims in PATH: OK
# => Checking `rbenv install' support: /usr/local/bin/rbenv-install (ruby-build 20221225)
# => Counting installed Ruby versions: 1 versions
# => Auditing installed plugins: OK
```
8. Check installed Ruby versions: 

```shell
rbenv versions 
# => * system
# => 2.7.4
```
9. Finally, install [rbenv-vars](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-vars). This is a plugin for rbenv that lets you set global and project-specific environment variables before spawning Ruby processes: ` brew install rbenv-vars `
10. Run ` which -a ruby ` to check that now there is another ruby installed alongside the built-in one.

```shell
which -a ruby
# => /Users/angelamador/.rbenv/shims/ruby
# => /usr/bin/ruby
```

#### Checking installed versions
- Check installed Ruby versions with rbenv with:  ` rbenv versions `  
- The one which is been using in this folder is highlighted with an ` * `
- You can choose which version have to be used:

```shell
rbenv local 3.1.2 # Set up version for this folder by generaling .rben-version file (only if this Ruby version has been previously installed)
rbenv global 3.1.2 # Set up default version if there is no specific one
```
- Also, you can **manually set the correct Ruby version** by add it in ` .ruby-version ` file (it affects all folder tree). Remenber that in a Rails project this version have to be the same specified in ` Gemfile`.

```shell
rbenv versions
# => system
# => * 2.7.4 (set by /Users/angelamador/.ruby-version)

ruby -v       
# => ruby 2.7.4p191 (2021-07-07 revision a21a3b7d23) [x86_64-darwin22]
```

#### Uninstalling rbenv and installed ruby versions

1. The goal is to uninstall all ruby versions installed by `rbenv` before uninstalling `rbenv` itself.
2.  Check installed ruby versions:  ` rbenv versions `
3. Uninstall all versions:

```shell
rbenv uninstall x.y.z # uninstall all versions from the last step`
```
4. Finally, uninstall ` rbenv `:
```shell
brew uninstall rbenv
```

## Rails 

1. Install Rails by running: ` sudo gem install rails `
2. Restart terminal.
3. Check installed version:

```shell
rails -v     
# => Rails 7.0.4
```

- To install one specific version of Rails: ` gem install rails -v 6.0.3 `

- Create a Rails project using a specific version of rails: `rbenv exec rails _6_0_3_ new my_project`. You can change project's Rails version like another gem dependencies in `Gemfile`. Don't forget run `bundle install` after that. [How to switch to another Rails version.](https://blog.adev42.com/how-to-switch-to-another-rails-version)

```
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'rails', '6.0.3'
```

#### Unistall gems
Since Rubygems 2.1, without gem names, it just removes all of them!  So simply run:

```
gem uninstall -aIx
```

Details of options:
-   `-a` Uninstall all matching versions
-   `-I` Ignore dependency requirements while uninstalling
-   `-x` Uninstall applicable executables without confirmation


#### Unistall Rails
Two steps to completelly remove Rails from the computer:
- `gem uninstall rails`  
- `gem uninstall railties`

## rbenv vs RVM - Why choose rbenv?

- RVM was widely accepted as the norm, greatly due to its wide toolkit.  
- rbenv has become a strong contender with its lightweight approach.

So, how do these tools get the job done? This is where things get a little scary with RVM. 

1. RVM overrides the `cd` shell command in order to load the current Ruby environment variables. Not only can the override cause unexpected behavior, but it also means that rubies and gemsets are loaded when switching directories.

2. rbenv does things on the fly by using shims to execute commands.
* A directory of shims (`~/.rbenv/shims`) is inserted to the front of `PATH`.  
* The directory holds a shim for every Ruby command.  
* The operating system searches for a shim that matches the name of the command, which in turn passes it to rbenv, determining the Ruby version to execute.

rbenv configuration for an app is dirt simple. Just create a `.ruby-version` file with Ruby version:

```yml
# .ruby-version file
2.3.0
```

The `RBENV_VERSION` variable also makes it easy to quickly specify a Ruby version via the command line. It’s first in line when rbenv checks for the current Ruby version.
